1. I think it's important that HTML is built on an open standard because of several reasons. One reason is that it allows
the language to be used in so many places. For example, if html was owned by a singular company it'd be unlikely that they'd allow html
to be used in all the places it is without any problems, and I don't mean legal wise. The amount of difficulty it'd take to maintain something as big and important
as html would require a lot of resources, and if a singular company owned it they'd probably also feel compelled to change it more so it seems like they're
actually working on it. However in it's current state, html is on it's 5th major version, it can be used almost anywhere or by anyone, and it's still recognizable and
still writable by people who've learned it years ago due to very minimal syntax changes.

2. An HTML element and a tag are very different things. The tag is just the identifier to tell the element what kind of element it is, but it doesn't include other things
such as attributes. So therefor the element is the start and end tag (if it has an end), the attributes, and anything thats held inside it. For example '<div id="myID>Hello!</div>' 
while div may be the tag, and you could refer to this as your "div element", you wouldnt be able to call this entire structure your div tag. The tag is only the 'div' and it wont 
include the 'id="myID"' or 'Hello!'.

3. In our class we used a quote from Yoda (I can't remember the one off the top of my head) that showed his broken english. The purpose of this quote was to explain to us how even
though we can take those words and actually understand the meaning behind them by rearranging them in our heads, our computer cannot do that for us. Meaning, if we don't format our
text in our HTML correctly so everything is presented in the correct way, we can't expect the computer to actually understand it's wrong and fix it for us.
