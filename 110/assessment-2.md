1. My favorite CSS property so far has got to be one we actually haven't gone over yet, but I really like it! It's called cursor! 
It works by changing the shape of the users mouse icon whenever they hover over your targeted content. I like it a lot because of how it can add life and interactivity to your 
webpage by signaling to your users that things are happening and can happen if they do something. There are quite a few values it can take, and they're all 
different possible visuals for your mouse such as a pointer, loading, and more!

2. If I had to create a menu for a resturaunt that included differentiating gluten-free and spicy foods, I would most likely use the class selector in CSS to make it happen. 
I would add a class called spicy for example to my specific food items, and then use CSS to color them red or something. .spicy { color: "red"; 

3. Inheritance in stylong is how children of a parent element can inherit some traits/styles from its parent depending on the content. The Cascading part however refers to the manner
in which styles are applied to things. If multiple attributes are added to an html tag, they will accumilate based on their specificity. Which leads us right into what is specificity?
Specificity is the ruling that makes it so if multiple styles should be on the same object, it will take the one of the highest specificity position. Meaning of an object is being affected
by a very broad selector as well as an inline style attribute, it will value the inline over the broad selector for what the final content will look like.
