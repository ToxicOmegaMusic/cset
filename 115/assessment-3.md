1. I think the most difficult part of developing a project as part of a larger team is to make sure I full understand how to perform the git workflow they are employing on the project.

2. A remote is a repository that multiple people working on the same project can all access. A branch is a version of the project that detaches from the main version to be worked on separately and later merged back 
into the main version when it is completed.

3. For the collaborative project this week, I used the feature branching workflow. I use this because for adding small features and updpates to my partners project, it made sense to do each one in a separate feature branch 
so the original developer can choose what to merge into his project and how to do it.
