1. After working on much bigger projects I actually feel a bit more anxious about working 
in the professional world. I think my biggest fear is not remembering the semantic uses of 
certain things and also not using the correct and most efficient method to do someting. I 
think a good way to adapt and overcome this would be to just try and keep myself as informed as 
possible, and checking resources like MDN for the best way to do something before I do it.

2. If I were making a choose your own adventure game, and I had to show the description of the next 
room to the user after they click a button, I would have to manipulate several things. The first thing 
I'd do is to link my button up to a function using the onclick attribute. After that, the way I would 
show the user the description for the new room would be to manipulate the document. I would need to 
mark an element of my document to be where all my in-game text goes. I will do this by giving it a 
unique ID. I will then use this ID in conjunction with document.querySelector() to get my HTML element
as an accessable javascript variable. After I have my variable, I can edit it simply by using the 
.textContent property to set the text within the element on the screen.

3. Different data structures are very useful to programmers. Sometimes you could do the same thing with 
an array as you could a set for example, however the things you actually plan on using it for aligns more 
with a set. Sure, both could work, however using a set will leave out some unneccissary features of an array, 
and even add new features for your set! Another example of this is with the Document Object Model itself, which 
would be a tree. Now, could the DOM be anything other than a tree? ... Yes! Would it be way more difficult to 
manage and make way less sense to look at and try to understand visually? Definitely also yes. It won't be the 
end of the world if you use the wrong data type, but it'll sure make your life a lot easier when you use the right 
one.
