1. For the upcoming weeks I'm definitely hoping to learn more about git and using it in a group. As well as just generally getting more comfortable with how to properly use it.

2. Bubbling in HTML is a term used to describe the way events will propogate from an element. For example, if you have two div's with one nested insie the other, and they both
have an onclick event linked to them; When you click the text inside the child div, it will first run that div's event, and then run the event of it's parent. HTML events propogate 
outward from their source.

3. One type of event is "keydown", and it has several unique properties. One unique property is repeat, which becomes true if the user is holding the key down. Another property of keydown
which is unique to it is it's keycode. Which gives the code of the key held down by the user. Another event is mousedown, which also has unique properties. Two of the properties it has
are offsetX and offsetY which track the mouses X and Y position across the screen in pixels.
