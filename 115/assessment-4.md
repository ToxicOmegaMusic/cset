1. I feel very comfortable answering questions like these in an actual job interview. I think doing these was a great 
practice and it helped me get comfortable with doing them more consistently. I think they help more then tests/quizzes because
for some reason that I'm not sure of, they make me actually kind of reflect on myself and really think of everything I learned 
rather than a test where I just try to rush through it and feel stressed.

2. In my current opinion (which will most likely change as I begin to actually test these tools) I think linters and code formatters seem 
the most beneficial or useful to me. I really like neat code and the idea of being able to set a standard to not only help with getting proper 
syntax but also code formatting would be insanely nice. It'd also help make the code easier to read and not sloppy and obvious many different people 
worked on it.


3. For my tic-tac-toe game I went through it very much with the waterfall methodology. I started with one major section and finished 
it and then moved to the next. I started with the HTML layout, figuring out what I'll need. Then moving to the CSS, which I worked on 
until I was satisfied. Then I moved to the javascript where I worked to put the last piece together in my project to complete it.
