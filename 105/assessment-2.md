Question 1: I think my biggest challenge with this program is going to be changing a lot of my 
outdated programming habits and practices. I started learned javascript around 2014 and a lot has changed
since then and I haven't taken the time to properly relearn it, so I definintely do a lot of things that are
now outdated. One example off the top of my head is using "let" instead of "var" I basically have var ingrained
in my head because thats how I've learned and what I used for many years of programming.

Question 2: The three different loops in Javascript are "for", "while", and "do while". The "for" loop is great for counters
and anything you'd need to run a certain amount of times instead of running until a condition changes. The "while" loop
is a great tool for when you do wan't to keep doing something until a condition changes, however on the surface, the 
"do while" loop does this exact same thing. Despite them being very similar on the surface, the "do while" loop will actually
run the code inside of it FIRST and then check the condition to see if it should loop back again. Where as "while" loop
will check the condition first and then decide if it should run/loop based on that.

Question 3: The method of problem solving where you use pseudocode first to problem solve is amazing and incredibly useful!
In my own personal projects I never really write out my pseudocode, but I always think my ideas through in pseudocode in
my head before starting to write them out. This method of problem solving is incredibly useful because it makes it so you 
don't have to worry about so much at once. What I mean by that is if you try just going straight in and writing your code,
you won't have a solid grasp on what order you need to do things on, or any sort of plan to start with, nor a solution. And
it's very difficult to write a program to do something that you haven't even figured out how to do. So it's an amazing benefit
to first take time to figure out the solution to your problem, and exactly what you need to do to get there, before you start
focusing on programming it.
