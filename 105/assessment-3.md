Question 1: I think the program is running great! It hasn't felt like it's dragging or rushing by too fast. I've been given plenty of resources to reference in 
case of confusion, and during our zoom sessions, everything is explainded in great detail and allows for questions. I also in general just think the speed we're 
bringing on new concepts is a really good speed that feels great to me.

Question 2: Functions are insanely useful for large programs for many reasons! A good way to explain I think would be to just tell someone to imagine their program WITHOUT 
any functions. First of all, there would likely be lots of the exact same code being run when it could be made easier by making it a function, and the code would also be way harder
to read and even work on by the creator because they wouldn't be able to see "Oh, this is my function that does this", all they'd see is a gigantic block of text.

Question 3: There are many ways to visualize the idea of "scope" to a learning programmer, and the one most used in our class is the zoo analogy. Anything within curly braces is in its
enclosure which they can't leave. If you're at a zoo it doesn't matter how cute that penguin is, you can't take it home with you. Likewise in programming, things that are created and
established within curly braces belong to that scope, that's their home.
