1. After completing this course I'd rate myself an 8/10. For the next course, I feel like I am going to try and go out
of my way to help my teammates more. I did try to help people this course but definitely not as much as I could considering
I was already comfortabl with the material.

2. Variables and values are two different ways to store data in Javascript. Variables are very good for data that is
self-isolated, or in otherwords: something that doesn't belong to anything else, and then on the otherhand, values
are data being stored that belongs to something else in your javascript program. For example, in our Weresquirrel example
we had used values for their purpose to track several different events in our 'Journal', as well as whether or not 
Jacques turned into a Weresquirrel. Every day in his journal is an object within an array. Those objects all have an
array called events, and a Boolean to say if he turned into a squirrel or not. Not only does using values in this 
example make more sense, but it also gives us many more great and easy to access options for iterating through this
journal and working with these values to get actual statistics and information from the data.

3.  The author chose to use values in the Weresquirrel example for several reasons. One reason is the ease of creating
and adding new data to the journal. Sure, it would've been possible to do this with variables, however the overall code
would look much more unorganized and would be harder to tell that these things all relate to eachother. Another reason is
because the whole purpose of thise journal was to get the statistics of what causes the Squirrel transformation out of it.
I don't think it would've been possible to simply and cleanly add all the data that we did and iterate through it to get data
out if we used variables. Since the values are within the objects, it helps us easily relate everything to eachother. So we
could easily go from our journal array to any event that happened on any day, very quickly and easily. There are several ways
I myself could've used values in my Adventure game, one example would be for some sort of inventory mechanic. Sure, it would
be possible with strings or even arrays, but it would be much more neat, understandable, and easy to work with if I used
values of an object for it.
